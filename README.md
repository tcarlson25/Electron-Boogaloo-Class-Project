# Electron-Boogaloo-Class-Project
This was a class project for CSCE-121 at Texas A&amp;M University

NOTE: All programs written within include the file "std_lib_facilities_4.h". A folder named "Graphics" contains all the neccessary files to compile the GUI programs.

The object of the game was to move satellites around a globe to maximize distance between each of them. The difficulty level was determined by the number of satellites to move. The game would end once the timer reached zero or the total 50 moves available was reached. The final score was determined by multiplying the least distance between two satellites by the number of satellites chosen with the difficulty level. The score was outputted to a text file and kept track of every score, while outputting the top five scores with the players initials on the start screen before the players begins. In order to create the satellites, we created objects (classes/structures) to hold appropriate values for each such as its position. Multiple functions were used to implement the distance calculation and to create objects on the screen. The graphical interface was created using FLTK.

This class was based on computer programming for engineers; use of primitive types, control structures, vectors, classes, strings, functions, file I/O, searching, sorting, lists, trees, maps, and graphics to solve engineering problems with computers; introduction to program structure, design, and development, plus the use of class libraries; includes the execution of student written programs in C++.
